# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: They keyword `this` pertains to a specific object that is instantiated from a class. Using the keyword `this` refers to the object and the object's own unique properties that may or may not be similar to other objects instantiated from the same class.

  Researched answer: `this` is a JavaScript keyword that references an object. Specifically an object that is derived from a certain class.

2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a JavaScript library that aids in making web applications and offers a more pleasureable experience during development and user interaction. Using React allows developers to build full applications that are both dynamic and scalable. From experience, working React is a breeze. I personally like how everything in React is a component and how state is monitored, which both help in making your web application dynamic.

  Researched answer: React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. React is used to build web pages, mobile web pages, and native mobile applications. React is composed of components and components are independent and reusable pieces of code. Components are combined together to form entire applications. Components ultimately help organize and scale applications with ease.

3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: From my understanding, the render method is required in a React class component. The render method is an important part in displaying the contents of a web application. The render method also rerenders the page after every state change within the componenet.

  Researched answer: render() is similar to the built-in JS function return. render() returns the content inside of the parentheses which is JSX. The render method contains the return() method and JSX lives inside the return() method.

4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX consists of JavaScript and something very similar to HTML and its use case is to add functionality using JavaScript directly into element tags that are based on HTML tags. One difference between HTML and JSX are attribute names. For example, when I worked with JSX, I had to get used to camel case since JSX uses this type of naming convention on their attributes. For example, a commonly used attribute in HTML is `class`. This same feature in JSX is `className`.

  Researched answer: JSX is JavaScript flavored HTML that behaves almost like HTML. The biggest difference is that JSX uses JavaScript directly in what looks like HTML to add logic and display data

5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a software that acts as a package manager. The purpose of a package manage is to be able to install packages which contain useful code snippets and JavaScript code that has been made from other developers. Other developers are able to utilize these packages which can greatly expedite development. One of the main use cases I've used yarn for is to create React applications. With just one terminal command, yarn install all of the dependencies needed to create a React application. Running this command creates some files such as: node_modules, package.json, and yarn.lock

  Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for your code that allows you to use and share JavaScript code with other developers. Yarn offers developers' solutions to different problems, making it easier for users to develop their software.

6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that is not assigned or saved to a variable, however functions the same way that a regular function would. I know that I've commonly worked with anonymous functions when using higher order functions such as map and filter. These higher order functions actually accept a function as a parameter, more so, an anonymous function.

1. Conditional rendering:
- Conditional rendering is a technique that is useful in order to control when information gets displayed. Utilizing the JavaScript logical operator "&&" content will not be displayed on a web page unless the condition is truthy.

2. Object-oriented programming:
- Often to referred OOP, Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that assists in dealing with the complexity of large software systems which have been known to difficulit to maintain as they often grew in complexity and size.

3. Ruby:
- Ruby is an object-oriented programming language that was created in the early 1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It is a general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically-typed, server-side scripting language.

4. Ruby blocks:
- Ruby blocks are similar to JavaScript anonymous functions. Blocks can be created with `do/end` keywords. Blocks are code that is passed to a method.

5. Ruby hashes:
- A hash is a container for data. This data is stored in key:value pairs like an object in JavaScript. There are a series of operations that can be used on a hash that can read, created, update, and deleted the contents of a has. Refer to the link below for a list of these operations.
